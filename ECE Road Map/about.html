            <h2>Why This Project?</h2>
            <p>Navigating the Electrical and Computer Engineering curriculum at UIC can be challenging. Choosing the right track, selecting appropriate courses, and finding professors whose teaching style fits your learning needs are crucial steps towards a successful academic journey.</p>
            <p>This roadmap was created by a fellow UIC Computer Engineering student to consolidate information and provide guidance based on common experiences within the ECE department. The goal is to help current and future students:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the different tracks and specializations available.</li>
                <li>See a potential path through the 4-year program.</li>
                <li>Identify courses that are foundational, highly recommended, or known to be challenging.</li>
                <li>Gain insights into selecting professors and planning course schedules effectively.</li>
            </ul>
