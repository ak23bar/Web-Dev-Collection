        <h1><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Professor & Course Selection Tips</h1>
        <p>Choosing the right courses and professors can significantly impact your learning experience and success in the ECE program. Here's some advice:</p>

        <section>
            <h2><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i> How to Pick Professors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Teaching Style Matters:</strong> Do you prefer theoretical depth or practical application? Fast-paced or methodical? Look for professors whose style matches your learning preference.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Course Syllabi:</strong> If available, review past syllabi for grading breakdowns, textbook choices, and course structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Ask Senior Students:</strong> Get firsthand accounts from students who have taken the course with specific professors. They often have valuable insights.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider Office Hours:</strong> A professor's availability and willingness to help outside of class can be crucial, especially for difficult subjects.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2><i class="fas fa-star-half-alt"></i> Importance of RateMyProfessor (with Caution)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Useful Starting Point:</strong> RateMyProfessor (RMP) can give you a general sense of student sentiment (difficulty, teaching quality, engagement).</li>
                <li><strong>Read Between the Lines:</strong> Look for trends in comments rather than focusing on extreme reviews (very positive or very negative). Are complaints consistent? What are the common praises?</li>
                <li><strong>Consider the Source:</strong> Reviews can be biased. A student who did poorly might leave a negative review, and vice versa. Filter reviews by course if possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Not the Only Factor:</strong> Don't base your entire decision on RMP. Combine it with other information like advice from peers and advisors.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Watch Out for Workload & Red Flags</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balance Your Schedule:</strong> Avoid taking too many notoriously difficult or time-consuming courses in the same semester. Check the 'Hardest Courses' sections on the track pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Unrealistic Expectations:</strong> Be wary of professors known for excessive workloads, unclear expectations, or consistently unfair grading. RMP and student feedback can highlight these issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Communication:</strong> Professors who are unresponsive or unclear in their communication can make a challenging course even harder.</li>
                <li><strong>Outdated Material:</strong> While fundamentals are key, ensure the course incorporates reasonably current practices and tools where applicable, especially in areas like software, AI, and digital systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> Take Advantage of Course Rotations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Some advanced electives or courses taught by specific popular professors might only be offered once a year or every few semesters.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Department Schedules:</strong> Look at tentative course schedules published by the ECE department to anticipate when key courses will be available.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility is Key:</strong> Be prepared to adjust your plan based on course availability and professor assignments, which can change semester to semester.</li>
                <li><strong>Advisor Consultation:</strong> Discuss long-term planning with your academic advisor to ensure you can take required and desired courses when needed.</li>
            </ul>
